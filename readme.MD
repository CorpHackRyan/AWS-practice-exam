Script designed to pick apart the aws_test.txt file and pull up random questions and allow user to enter the answer. 
If answer is correct, inform user. 

# SCOPE:
- Need to be able to find a random "QUESTION {x}", where X is  a random number generated to pick a question
- Some questions have more than one line, so need to be able to read up until "A."
- Then check against answer given from user and verify. 

 Things to think about:
 - Set a timer?"
 - Allow user to enter how many questions they want
 - Track how many right/wrong
 - Keep records forever, so they can know if they got it wrong in the past
