QUESTION 87
How would an AWS customer easily apply common access controls to a large set of users?

A.   Apply an IAM policy to an IAM group.
B.   Apply an IAM policy to an IAM role.
C.   Apply the same IAM policy to all IAM users with access to the same workload.
D.   Apply an IAM policy to an Amazon Cognito user pool.

Correct Answer: A
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Instead of defining permissions for individual IAM users, it's usually more convenient to create groups that relate to job functions (administrators, developers,
accounting, etc.). Next, define the relevant permissions for each group. Finally, assign IAM users to those groups. All the users in an IAM group inherit the
permissions assigned to the group. That way, you can make changes for everyone in a group in just one place. As people move around in your company, you can
simply change what IAM group their IAM user belongs to.

QUESTION 90
Which of the following is an AWS Cloud architecture design principle?

A.   Implement single points of failure.
B.   Implement loose coupling.
C.   Implement monolithic design.
D.   Implement vertical scaling.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Loose coupling between services can also be done through asynchronous integration. It involves one component that generates events and another that
consumes them. The two components do not integrate through direct point-to-point interaction, but usually through an intermediate durable storage layer. This
approach decouples the two components and introduces additional resiliency. So, for example, if a process that is reading messages from the queue fails,
messages can still be added to the queue to be processed when the system recovers.

QUESTION 91
Which of the following security measures protect access to an AWS account? (Select TWO.)

A.   Enable AWS CloudTrail.
B.   Grant least privilege access to IAM users.
C.   Create one IAM user and share with many developers and users.
D.   Enable Amazon CloudFront.
E. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged users.

Correct Answer: BE
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
If you decided to create service accounts (that is, accounts used for programmatic access by applications running outside of the AWS environment) and generate
access keys for them, you should create a dedicated service account for each use case. This will allow you to restrict the associated policy to only the permissions
needed for the particular use case, limiting the blast radius if the credentials are compromised. For example, if a monitoring tool and a release management tool
both require access to your AWS environment, create two separate service accounts with two separate policies that define the minimum set of permissions for
each tool.

QUESTION 147
When is it beneficial for a company to use a Spot Instance?

A.   When there is flexibility in when an application needs to run.
B.   When there are mission-critical workloads.
C.   When dedicated capacity is needed.
D.   When an instance should not be stopped.

Correct Answer: A
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate. Cloud service providers
invest in hardware resources and then release those resources (often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers. One of the problems with this business model, however,
is that at any given time, there are likely to be compute resources that are not being utilized.
These resources represent hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not making AWS any money at the moment.
Rather than allowing these computing resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted rate, with the understanding that if someone needs
those resources for running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.
In fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed elsewhere.

QUESTION 149
How does AWS charge for AWS Lambda?

A.   Users bid on the maximum price they are willing to pay per hour.
B.   Users choose a 1-, 3- or 5-year upfront payment term.
C.   Users pay for the required permanent storage on a file system or in a database.
D.   Users pay based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources.

Correct Answer: D
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute. When code
starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a request. It will charge the total number of requests across all of the functions used. Duration is
calculated by the time when your code started executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 100ms. The AWS Lambda pricing depends on
the amount of memory that the user used to allocate to the function.

QUESTION 150
What function do security groups serve related Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance security?

A.   Act as a virtual firewall for the Amazon EC2 instance.
B.   Secure AWS user accounts with AWS identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
C.   Provide DDoS protection with AWS Shield.
D.   Use Amazon CloudFront to protect the Amazon EC2 instance.

Correct Answer: A
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance on Amazon
EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.
After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.
AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we don't recommend this
practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) Or you can create a security group that you want for your specific applications.
To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process easier.

QUESTION 151
Which disaster recovery scenario offers the lowest probability of down time?

A.   Backup and restore
B.   Pilot light
C.   Warm standby
D.   Multi-site active-active

Correct Answer: D
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Backup and Restore: a simple, straightforward, cost-effective method that backs up and restores data as needed. Keep in mind that because none of your data is
on standby, this method, while cheap, can be quite time-consuming.
Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and data at the ready so that it can be quickly
retrieved if needed.
Warm Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your business' core elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime and an
almost seamless transition.
Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your company's data/ applications between two or more active locations and splits
your traffic/usage between them. If a disaster strikes, everything is simply rerouted to the unaffected area, which means you'll suffer almost zero downtime.
However, by running two separate environments simultaneously, you will obviously incur much higher costs.

Which of the following provides the ability to share the cost benefits of Reserved Instances across AWS accounts?

A.   AWS Cost Explorer between AWS accounts
B.   Linked accounts and consolidated billing
C.   Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Reserved Instance Utilization Report
D.   Amazon EC2 Instance Usage Report between AWS accounts

Correct Answer: B
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
The way that Reserved Instance discounts apply to accounts in an organization's consolidated billing family depends on whether Reserved Instance sharing is
turned on or off for the account. By default, Reserved Instance sharing for all accounts in an organization is turned on. You can change this setting by Turning Off
Reserved Instance Sharing for an account.
The capacity reservation for a Reserved Instance applies only to the account the Reserved Instance was purchased on, regardless of whether Reserved Instance
sharing is turned on or off.

QUESTION 167
Which architectural principle is used when deploying an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance in Multiple Availability Zone mode?

A.   Implement loose coupling.
B.   Design for failure.
C.   Automate everything that can be automated.
D.   Use services, not servers.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database
workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a
standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly
reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that
you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your
application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.
Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/

QUESTION 168

QUESTION 169
What is a benefit of loose coupling as a principle of cloud architecture design?

A.   It facilitates low-latency request handling.
B.   It allows applications to have dependent workflows.
C.   It prevents cascading failures between different components.
D.   It allows companies to focus on their physical data center operations.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces inter-dependencies. Your components need to be loosely coupled to avoid changes or failure in one
of the components from affecting others.
Your infrastructure also needs to have well defined interfaces that allow the various components to interact with each other only through specific, technology-
agnostic interfaces. Modifying any underlying operations without affecting other components should be made possible.

QUESTION 172
How can a customer increase security to AWS account logons? (Choose two.)

A.   Configure AWS Certificate Manager
B.   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
C.   Use Amazon Cognito to manage access
D.   Configure a strong password policy
E.   Enable AWS Organizations

Correct Answer: BC
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Your root account should always be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This additional layer of security helps protect against unauthorized logins to
your account by requiring two factors: something you know (a password) and something you have (for example, an MFA device). AWS supports virtual and
hardware MFA devices and U2F security keys.
Cognito can be used as an Identity Provider (IdP), where it stores and maintains users and credentials securely for your applications, or it can be integrated with
OpenID Connect, SAML, and other popular web identity providers like Amazon.com.
Using Amazon Cognito, you can generate temporary access credentials for your clients to access AWS services, eliminating the need to store long-term
credentials in client applications.

What is the purpose of AWS Storage Gateway?

A.   It ensures on-premises data storage is 99.999999999% durable.
B.   It transports petabytes of data to and from AWS.
C.   It connects to multiple Amazon EC2 instances.
D.   It connects on-premises data storage to the AWS Cloud.

Correct Answer: D
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
Moving data to the cloud is not quite as simple as flipping a switch. For companies that have managed their own data centers or server rooms for decades, there
are a few steps to consider --and it's not always wise to pull the plug on an internal infrastructure quite so quickly. If a startup uses on-premise business servers
and then experiences unexpected growth, abandoning those servers doesn't make sense (even if the long-term plan is to do exactly that).
AWS Storage Gateway is a way to bridge this gap for companies of any size. It's a hybrid storage option that connects on-premise storage including age-old tape
backup systems to the cloud in a way that also provides one console to access all storage configurations.

Which of the AWS global infrastructure is used to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users across the globe?

A.   AWS Regions
B.   Availability Zones
C.   Edge locations
D.   Data centers

Correct Answer: C
Explanation

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
When your web traffic is geo-dispersed, it's not always feasible and certainly not cost effective to replicate your entire infrastructure across the globe. A CDN
provides you the ability to utilize its global network of edge locations to deliver a cached copy of web content such as videos, webpages, images and so on to your
customers. To reduce response time, the CDN utilizes the nearest edge location to the customer or originating request location in order to reduce the response
time. Throughput is dramatically increased given that the web assets are delivered from cache. For dynamic data, many CDNs can be configured to retrieve data
from the origin servers.
